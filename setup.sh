## Above code generated using the DeepSeek R1 model through Perplexity, and then tweaked. The prompt was:
##
## Can you generate a setup.sh bash script that runs
## 1. creates a Python virtual environment using `python -m venv .venv` (if a virtual environment at .venv doesn't already exist)
## 2. activates the virtual environment (if not already activated) using `source .venv/bin/activate`
## 3. installs requirements from requirements.txt using pip install -r requirements.txt
## 4. runs scripts/make_dataset.sh, a bash script that loads a dataset into the data/raw/ directory. We should only run this script if the data/raw directory is empty.
## 5. runs traditional/preprocessingML.py, which generates features for a traditional ML model
## 6. runs traditional/modelML.py, which generates serialized model and encoder
